This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
It allows two players to take turns marking `X` and `O` on a 3x3 grid.
The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the result when a player wins or if the match ends in a draw. 
You can also reset the game to play again.
It's a fun and easy project to understand basic DOM manipulation and game logic in JavaScript.
